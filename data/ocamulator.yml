    Ocamulator is a NES emulator written in OCaml. A NES emulator is an engine
    that simulates the hardware of the Nintendo Entertainment System, allowing
    older games like Super Mario Bros. built specifically for the NES console to
    be played on modern computers. Ocamulator simulates the CPU and RAM of the
    NES, so it can parse and simulate the execution of NES game ROMs. Ocamulator
    also features a simple GUI that allows users to play certain NES games like
    Snake, Skier, and Maze, along with a whole variety of simple animations.
    Currently, scrolling games like Super Mario Bros. are not supported, but we
    hope to add support for them in the future.
