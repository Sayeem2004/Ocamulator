    Ocamulator is a NES emulator written in OCaml, which is an engine that
    simulates the hardware of the Nintendo Entertainment System to allow users
    of modern computers to play older games for this system. Ocamulator
    simulates the CPU and RAM of the NES, so it can parse and simulate the
    execution of NES game ROMs as well as any other programs written for the NES
    6502. Ocamulator also features a simple GUI that allows users to play
    certain NES games like Snake, Skier, and Maze, along with a whole variety of
    simple animations, all of which must implement graphics in a specific way.
    Ocamulator currently does not support games with more advanced graphical
    features, like Super Mario Bros., but we plan to add support for them in the
    future.
