    Ocamulator is a NES emulator written in OCaml. A NES emulator is an engine
    that simulates the hardware of the Nintendo Entertainment System, allowing
    older games like Super Mario Bros. to be played on modern computers.
    Ocamulator supports a command line interface that allows users to enter the
    path to a ROM file. After the ROM file is parsed a GUI is displayed that is
    connected to the keyboard. All visual and audio effects from the original
    game should be present, and there should be bonus emulator features such as
    speeding up the game or creating new keybindings.
