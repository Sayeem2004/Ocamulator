(** [main ()] enters the main pipeline for this project. For now it is useless
    and just prints a couple things while we work on other files. However, when
    implemented it will start by parsing the ROM file specified by the first
    command line argument and initializing the CPU and RAM states. It then
    displays the game in a separate window and modifies CPU and RAM states when
    needed to play the game. The function will not end until the game window is
    closed. *)
